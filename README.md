# Arduino-SmartCitizen
A custom web interface to store data from Arduino Smartcitizen on a local server in a csv file

The code is an extract from the repo provided by SmartCitizen at https://github.com/fablabbcn/Smart-Citizen-Kit

Few minor fixes to make it work on the a local Apache server. Tested on Ubuntu.
